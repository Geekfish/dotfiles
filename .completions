# To make Homebrew’s completions available in zsh,
# you must get the Homebrew-managed zsh site-functions on your FPATH
# before initialising zsh’s completion facility.
# Add the following to your ~/.zshrc file:
if type brew &>/dev/null; then
  FPATH=$(brew --prefix)/share/zsh/site-functions:$FPATH

  autoload -Uz compinit
  compinit
fi
# This must be done before compinit is called.
# Note that if you are using Oh My Zsh, it will call compinit for you,
# so this must be done before you call oh-my-zsh.sh.
# 
# Checkout brew completion instructions here for alternatives:
