## About

This is just my personal guide for keeping track of my configurations and facilitate setting up a new machine.

### Optional

Depending on current projects

- 🐘 [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/)
- 🐍 [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)<sup>1</sup>
- 🐳 [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- 📜 [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#osx--linux--bashonwindows-install-instructions)
- With brew:
  ```zsh
  brew install \
    kubernetes-cli             `# Kubernetes utils` \
    basex                      `# XML database and XPath/XQuery processor` \
    TomAnthony/brews/itermocil `# iTerm-specific teamocil` \
    gmp                        `# Sometimes needed by ruby`

  brew tap shopify/shopify && brew install shopify `# shopify CLI`  
  brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku `# Heroku CLI`
  ```

## Nix - Experimental

To install:

```zsh
<(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)

nix-build https://github.com/LnL7/nix-darwin/archive/master.tar.gz -A installer
./result/bin/darwin-installer
```

## Dotfiles

Assuming you checkout this repo in your `$HOME` directory, you can run the following to symlink all the dotfiles:

```zsh
cd dotfiles
./install_config.sh
```

⚠️ The above will prompt you about replacing existing dotfiles in case there's something you'd rather keep. The `.git` directory (and any other directory) is ignored.

### Completions

You can install optional completions by running:

```zsh
./install_completions.sh
```

### GPG

To store GPG passphrases in the keychain, you need to run:

```zsh
mkdir -p -m 0700 ~/.gnupg
echo 'pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac' | tee ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
pkill -TERM gpg-agent
```

and restart the terminal session.

Next time you're asked for the passphrase, it will be stored in the keychain.

## Fonts

`Fira Code` is a good monospace font for coding that supports [ligatures](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Ligature_(writing)). It can be installed using `brew` (see above).
Further config might be required depending on the editor, [see here for VSCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/VS-Code-Instructions).
